# OS Scheduling Simulator

An interactive web-based simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms. This tool helps visualize and understand different CPU scheduling algorithms commonly used in operating systems.

## Features

- Multiple scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  - Non-Preemptive Highest Priority First (NPHPF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
- Process metrics calculation (Waiting Time, Turnaround Time)
- Random process generation

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- No external dependencies
